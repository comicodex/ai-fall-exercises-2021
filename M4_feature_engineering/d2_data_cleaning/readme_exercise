np.nan
2. How to replace all occurences of the value 9999 to missing in pandas?
df = df.replace(9999, np.nan)
3. How to get the absolute number of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isna().sum()
4. How to get the percentage of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isna().sum / (len(df)) * 100
5. How to drop rows with missing values?
df.dropna(axis=0)
6. How to drop variables with missing values?
df.dropna(axis=1)
7. What is the univariate imputation method in sklearn?
It's a strategy to impute missing values using statistics (mean, median) of the column with missing values (one feature)
8. What is the multivariate imputation method in sklearn?
It's a strategy to impute missing values in function of the other features (variables) and then estimates the imputation
9. What is the best univariate imputation method to categorical variables? (Explain why)
SimpleImputer to fill missing values with the most frequent value (strategy=most_frequent)
10. What is the best univariate imputation method to numerical variables? (Explain why)
SimpleImputer to fill missing values with the mean (or median) of that feature

3. What is novelty detection?
It's a method to determine whether new or unusual data are within the norm or are outliers
